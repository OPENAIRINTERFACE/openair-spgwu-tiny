# Build and deploying OAI-SPGW-U in OpenShift cluster #

## Pre-requisite ##

To build our images, we SHALL use the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms` repository with all the proper development libraries.

This repository is not directly accessible from the UBI RHEL8 image (`registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest`).

So we need to copy, from a registered RHEL8 machine, certificates and subsccription manager configuration files.

On a `RHEL8` physical machine (or a virtual machine) connected to the OpenShift Cluster, recover the entitlement and the RH subscription manager configs:

```bash
oc create configmap rhsm-conf --from-file /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf
oc create configmap rhsm-ca --from-file /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem

oc create secret generic etc-pki-entitlement --from-file /etc/pki/entitlement/{NUMBER_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER}.pem --from-file /etc/pki/entitlement/{NUMBER_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER}-key.pem
```

These configmaps and secret will be shared by all the build configs in your OC project. No need to do it each time.

## Launching the Build ##

On a machine connected to the OpenShift Cluster, create the target image stream and the build configuration.

Note that the project name is currently hard-coded to `oai`.

**TODO: pass as env variables: branch name, image tag and project name**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OPENAIRINTERFACE/openair-spgwu-tiny.git
cd openair-spgwu-tiny
git checkout develop
oc apply -f openshift/oai-spgwu-tiny-image-stream.yml
oc apply -f openshift/oai-spgwu-tiny-build-config.yml
```

Note that this step has to be done once before the first build and if you modify the yaml files.

Then anytime you want to build:

```bash
oc start-build oai-spgwu-tiny-build-config --follow
```

The `--follow` might break.

```bash
oc logs build/oai-spgwu-tiny-build-config-XYZ --follow
```

where `XYZ` is the build number.

You should see a successful buid when :

```bash
